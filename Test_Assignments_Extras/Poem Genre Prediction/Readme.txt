2 different ways of approaching the problem have been implemented.

1. Bayes Theoram has been used in the first method. Bernaulli Naive Bayes Classifier was used. The code can be run on any machine wihtout GPU.
   Accuracy : 100% which is really great for the dataset used.

2. Support Vector Machine has been used which yields an accuracy of 54%.
